# SharkAttacks-DataDive

This DataDive uses:
  WordClouds to see what are the most prevalent outcomes of a shark attack along with what are the most prevalent types of sharks in shark attacks.
  Logistic regressions to find which shark species, activities, and areas are associated and possibly predict the most dangerous outcomes in a shark attack.
